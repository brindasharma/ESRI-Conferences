## Embed ArcGIS Demo

### The Incident Management Application, which is built on the ArcGIS API for JavaScript and embeds ArcGIS Partner User Types  ( Named User Login Model)

In this application the office_manager, which on the back end is a Standard Partner user type can create and edit recent incidents. Once the incident is created then
the field worker who is a Basic User Type can edit the incident ticket but not create one

All the feature layers are created in ArcGIS Online and shared with users via group sharing
